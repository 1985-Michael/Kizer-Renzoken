        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
                My name is Michael A. Myers, and I am a web Developer in training, but before I set out on the 
           journey to become a programmer, allow me to tell you a story of how it all started. A long time ago, 
           in a galaxy far far away...opps, wrong story. That was my other life when I was a nefarious space slug. 
           I still have'nt forgiving Solo for stepping on me, anyways where are my manners. 
           Let's continue with the right story. 
          </p>
          <p>
           After Highschool, I did'nt know what I wanted to do, so 
           I did what every young adult does, "party". It wasn't until, I turned 19 that my dad said, "That I need to do 
           something with my life". I replied by saying, "Don't tell me how to live my life", but shortly after I packed 
           up my things and headed to Fort Jackson, South Carolina for The United States Army's Basic Training Program. 
           This story gets really boring, so lets fast forward 8 years later.
          </p>
           <p>
           After being deployed 3 times to Iraq, I decided to retire. I just could'nt risk another Deployment. 
           I came back to Los Angeles to fulfill ummm something. I took advantage of the services provided to Veterans. 
           I used my GI Bill to attend an Art School. I have always been good at Art, so I said why in the hell not? Lets 
           fast forward 4 years later. I graduated with a B.S in Media Arts and was awarded Best Portfolio. 2 weeks later I 
           landed my first job as a graphic Designer making 15 dollars an hour. I know what you're thinking all that for  
           15 dollars? Well, you have to start somewhere. 3 years later I'm curently the lead graphic Designer at PrideSash. 
           The company put me on Salary and sent me to Coding Bootcamp at UCLA Extension for  Web Developer Postion.
